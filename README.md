Read the post [here](https://www.codementor.io/lautiamkok/creating-a-modular-koa-application-cfprkirld) about this repository.

Quick start
=============

``` bash

$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

# build for production and launch server
$ npm start
```

# Notes

1. During the development, use: `$ npm run dev`

2. [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) is used to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).
