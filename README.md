> A basic example creating a Koa modular application + MongoDB.

Read the post [here](https://scotch.io/@lautiamkok/creating-a-modular-koa-application) about this repository.

quick start
=============

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm start
```

# Notes

2. [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) is used to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).
